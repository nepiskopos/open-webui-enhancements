# Open WebUI stuff
Custom functionality and RAG developed and implemented for the [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) tool.

This is a collection of custom Tools, Functions and Pipelines created for the Open WebUI tool.

These procedures were developed while I was experimenting with the Open WebUI tool during my employment at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) while working on a project for the [National Bank of Greece (NBG)](https://www.nbg.gr/en/).
