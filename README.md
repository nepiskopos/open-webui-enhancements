# Open WebUI stuff

This repository contains custom tools, functions, and pipeline enhancements developed for the [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) platform. 

These additions extend the core functionality of Open WebUI, focusing on prompt engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and other experimental features.

The implementation is written in Python and leverages Azure OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o model.

These solutions were created during my time at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com), as part of a project for the [National Bank of Greece (NBG)](https://www.nbg.gr/en/), while exploring and customizing the Open WebUI framework.
