# Open WebUI Enhancements

This repository showcases a collection of custom tools, functions, and pipeline extensions built on top of the [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) platform. 

These enhancements were developed to explore and extend the capabilities of Open WebUI, with a focus on:

    ðŸ§  Prompt engineering

    ðŸ”Ž Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

    ðŸ§ª Experimental LLM workflows

All components are implemented in Python, leveraging Azure OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o model for advanced natural language understanding and generation.

These solutions were developed during my time at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com), as part of the Digital Transformation project for the [National Bank of Greece (NBG)](https://www.nbg.gr/en/), where I was tasked with exploring and customizing the Open WebUI framework to meet complex enterprise needs.
